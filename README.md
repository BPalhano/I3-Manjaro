## Manjaro i3 Settings.

Manjaro is a operational system based in Arch Linux, you can find a link to download the .ISO in [this link](https://manjaro.org/downloads/community/i3/)
In this repositore i will show how i configurated the system, and my personal opnion about how the Manjaro i3 can be a better system.I did this repo because i wanted to crave my learning about this system and the tiling window mananger (i3). Also to safe configurations, do some tests and etc.


Guess help :P
