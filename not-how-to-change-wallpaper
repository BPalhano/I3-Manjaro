simply go to the execution command ($mod + D) and search for:

- nitrogen

and enter. You will find a interface with various wallpapers. 
To add some wallpaper, go to the preference button in the right corner and see the path to the directory with the wallpapers. Go to that path and add the file 
that you want and close 'n open. 

Usually, the path is 

- /usr/share/backgrounds

so, if you want to put a wallpaper here, you can use this command, if you are in the directory that has the wallpaper:

sudo mv <name-of-the-file.jgp> /usr/share/backgrounds
